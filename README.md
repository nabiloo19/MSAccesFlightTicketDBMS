# MSAccesFlightTicketDBMS
A Microsoft Database project for a flight ticket agency, using Access 2016

It contains a word file where the software design phases are elaborated.
Additionally, there's a .txt file where the SQL commands are listedout, alongside screen-shots of the implementation as an Android Application, for the time being.
Finally is the MSAccess database project where a user can enter his/her data and issue a ticket, while also an Admin can ensure the flow of all of that.
